Word Counter

Assumptions: 

- All Files being read would already be downloaded locally and stored in a location where the local user can read them
- As shown in the example, special characters will be counted within words and the only separator for a word is a space
- Prior to execution, the location of the file will be specified in the main method by the user
- Multiple files will not be attempted at once
- Directories will not be attempted to be read at once
