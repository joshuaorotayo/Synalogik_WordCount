Vowels
We can improve our success by insisting that a word have at least one vowel, since nearly every word in English has one (except fly, by and a few others). Like this:

ectot gjaqv kuifg vzicu zspsu pdidb wqdis uerrs ucgej okimw
fnevz ewxko ljgew aglgo jpfoq dcytu uwkcj dzioy wekdx xuybk
This is a great improvement. More words can be pronounced.

But there are still lots of strange words like "zspsu" and "xuybk"

Letter Frequency
So, our next improvement is to use less of the letters like j, x, z and q and more of the letters like e, t and s.

In fact the frequency of letters in the English Language is well known. Here is how many times you would expect to see a letter in every 1,000 letters:
